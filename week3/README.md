# Titanic Survival Classifier (TensorFlow.js)

This project is a **browser-based machine learning app** that predicts Titanic passenger survival using the Kaggle dataset.  
It is built with **TensorFlow.js** and **tfjs-vis**, and runs entirely in the browser without a backend.

## ðŸš© Fixed Issues

### 1. Comma Escape Problem in CSV
**Problem:**  Titanic dataset has passenger names like  
"Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer)".  
If you split CSV lines just by ,, the name breaks into multiple columns â†’ data loads incorrectly.  
**Fix:** Use PapaParse library instead of manual string splitting.  
PapaParse correctly reads CSV files with quotes and commas inside text fields.  

Example:
Papa.parse(fileText, { header: true, dynamicTyping: true, skipEmptyLines: true });

### 2. Evaluation Table Not Showing
**Problem:** After training, evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix) didnâ€™t show.  
Cause â†’ mismatch in how TensorFlow.js logs metrics (acc vs accuracy) and missing DOM updates.  
**Fix:** Updated the evaluation step to:  
- Use logs.acc || logs.accuracy safely.  
- Calculate confusion matrix and metrics manually from predictions.  
- Always update the evaluation <div> with results.

### 3. Summarizing the Code Logic

Here is the high-level workflow of the app:

**Load Data**  
- User uploads train.csv and test.csv.  
- Data parsed with PapaParse.  

**Inspect Data**  
- Display preview tables (first 10 rows).  
- Show basic visualizations (survival by sex/class) using tfjs-vis.  

**Preprocess Data**  
- Fill missing values with median (Age, Fare) or mode (Embarked).  
- Normalize numerical features.  
- One-hot encode categorical features (Sex, Pclass, Embarked).  
- Optionally add engineered features: FamilySize and IsAlone.  

**Create Model**  
- Build a neural network in TensorFlow.js:  
  - Input layer  
  - Dense hidden layers with ReLU  
  - Output layer with Sigmoid  
- Compile with Adam optimizer + binary crossentropy loss.  

**Train Model**  
- Split data into training/validation sets.  
- Train the model for several epochs.  
- Visualize training progress (loss & accuracy curves).  

**Evaluate Model**  
- Predict on validation set.  
- Show confusion matrix and metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1.  
- Allow adjusting decision threshold with a slider.  

**Predict & Export**  
- Predict survival on test set.  
- Export results as submission.csv for Kaggle.
